#
#   @about      The most simpliest of examples for deserializing and parsing
#               serial packets.
#
#               |       PACKET      |
#               | <marker> | <data> |
#
#               <marker>    -   Uniquely identifies the start of a packet
#               <data>      -   The data section of the packet
#
#   @notes      There are a few disadvantages and limitations to this
#               implementation...
#                   1)  Length is calculated and explicitly defined on the 
#                       receiving side (this side) and also the sending side.
#                       Ideally, we should define it on the sending side as a 
#                       field in the packet. This way the receiving side could 
#                       parse the length field and use it as input into the 
#                       serial.read function to get the remainder of the packet
#                   2)  There is no way to validate the contents of the packet.
#                       Ideally, a mechanism would be used to validate the 
#                       contents (e.g. CRC, Checksum). This would require we 
#                       add an additional field (preferrably on the end of the 
#                       packet).
#                   3)  All the above would require a more elaborate packet 
#                       protocol (e.g. CCSDS). Since this is a keep it simple 
#                       stupid example a CCSDS protocol is out of scope.
#
#   @sender     Below is the packet implementation on the sender side that is 
#               being implemented.
#                   from pyb import UART

#                           self.m = m

#                           self.z = z

#                               self.y,
#                               self.z)
#                   uart = UART(1, 115200)
#                   pkt = Packet(0xdeadbeef, 0xaa, 0xbb, 0xcc)
#                   while True:
#                       time.sleep(1)
#                       uart.write(pkt.serialize())
